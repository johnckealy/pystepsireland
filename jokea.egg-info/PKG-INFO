Description: # Steps Rainfall
        
        This project concerns the extrapolation of rainfall radar for accurate short-scale rain forecasts. 
        
        
        
        ## Lessons learned so far
        
        Some trouble installing with both conda and pip. It seems that the problem was in naming my files "pysteps" â€“ this caused a clash with the package directories.
        
        To get the Met Eireann h5 files to work, I had to hack the source to set RATE to DZDB in the importers module. I'll need to find a less hacky fix for this that doesnt mess with the source.
        
        You must place Met Eireann's h5 files in ./radar/<date>/
